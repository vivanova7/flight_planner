Flight Planner
A simple flight planning application with RESTful API endpoints for managing cities, airports, flights, and connecting flights.

Features
Manage cities, airports, flights, and connecting flights.
Supports data persistence in files or an SQL database.
RESTful API with endpoints for CRUD operations.
Requirements for student implementation:
You are allowed to edit all files, except flight_planner/app.py, and to a much lesser degree - flight_planner/app.py.
Make sure to preserve the API and most of flight_planner/routes.py - edit to fit your own services implementation.
The test_services.py file provides basic logic tests for your services implementation. Your code should pass these tests if it is valid.
