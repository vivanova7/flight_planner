Flight Planner
A simple flight planning application with RESTful API endpoints for managing cities, airports, flights, and connecting flights.

Features
Manage cities, airports, flights, and connecting flights.
Supports data persistence in files or an SQL database.
RESTful API with endpoints for CRUD operations.
Requirements for student implementation:
You are allowed to edit all files, except flight_planner/app.py, and to a much lesser degree - flight_planner/app.py.
Make sure to preserve the API and most of flight_planner/routes.py - edit to fit your own services implementation.

Note: The test_services.py file provides basic logic tests for your services implementation. Your code should pass these tests if it is valid.

Dockerfile and setup.py are provided optionally.

Basic points: 15pts (For correct implementation of the base task)

Bonus points:
For importing data from a CSV file (no export) (+1 pt)
For file-based storage (both loading and saving) (+2 pt)
For SQL-based storage (both loading and saving) (+2 pt)
For correct and passing unit tests (test_services.py) (+1 pt)
NOTE: In case you're providing multiple storage mechanisms, your services layer should select the appropriate data store (In memory / File-based / SQL-based) based on the value of the DATA_STORE environment variable. If DATA_STORE is not set, or inmemory, use the In Memory store. If it is equal to file, use the File-based store. If it is equal to sql, use the SQL-based store.

NOTE: Your data stores should have only optional arguments, thus allowing instantiation without any arguments.

Explanation:
Directory Structure: The project is organized into a package named flight_planner with submodules for different components like models, routes, services, and persistence.

Persistence Options: Two persistence options are provided: FileStorage for file-based storage and SQLStorage for SQLite database storage.

Virtual Environment: The requirements.txt file lists the dependencies needed for the project.
